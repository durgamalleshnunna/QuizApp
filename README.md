A React app is a web application built using the React JavaScript library, designed for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, allowing for reusable UI elements and efficient state management. React apps can be optimized for performance using features like virtual DOM, hooks, and server-side rendering.
